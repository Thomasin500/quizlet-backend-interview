# Quizlet Backend Interview Question

## What's this for?

For your upcoming interview, we'll ask you to build an HTTP-based API that won't have to deal with authentication or other servers. We believe in setting up candidates for success, so we want to help you get set up with the tools you're most comfortable with.

You're welcome to use the framework, language, and build process you're most familiar with.

## Your options:

1. Start with the provide subfolder `node-express`. This is a starting example that you can use and build on top of. [More details on running this example here](node-express/).
2. Set up your own environment (Ruby, Python, Java... whatever you desire!).  Please note that if your chosen framework abstracts too much of the problem away, we might ask you for a finer-grained implementation. A microframework like Express, Flask, or Sinatra is more appropriate than a “batteries-included” framework like Ruby on Rails.

**Bottom line**: We want you to be successful, so please pick the option that you feel most at-ease with.

**Questions**? We're happy to help. Just email your recruiter and we'll get back to you.
